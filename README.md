<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->


## About The Project

This is a landing page for OpenAuto with User response capturing.
Here's are the features:
* User can submit their response.  
* This project is included a single API route that will handle the POST request of the form.
* Through mongoose, we have connected our app to MongoDB Cluster.
* Upon successful submisson, the response would be stored in MongoDB cloud.
* Proper form validatios.  
* User cannot use same email for multiple response submission, if so an error will be shown.    
* Upon successful submission of the form, user can able to see the success message.  
* User response would be stored in MongoDB Database on cloud.

## Backend API Route & Database:
Project's backend code is available in the [Api_backend_Route](https://github.com/gangadhar5613/vocally_task/tree/main/pages/api) folder in the same repo.
- This route will handle the POST request and initially it will check for the duplicate user through email id and gives the response incase of duplicate user OR create a new user and send the response to the front-end.

#### Database
- In this project, I have used NoSQL Database: MongoDB.
- I have connected the MongoDB clusted to our app using mongoose.
- Inside of this [folder](https://github.com/gangadhar5613/vocally_task/tree/main/models) you can see the Schema Model of the User.
